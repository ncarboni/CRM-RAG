# These are system-level defaults used when a dataset doesn't specify its own interface config.
# For dataset-specific customization, add an 'interface' section to your dataset in datasets.yaml.

# Page and header titles (generic defaults)
page_title: "CIDOC-CRM RAG Chat"
header_title: "CIDOC-CRM RAG System"

# Welcome message (shown when chat loads)
welcome_message: "Hello! I'm your cultural heritage assistant. Select a dataset from the dropdown above, then ask me questions about the knowledge graph."

# Input placeholder text
input_placeholder: "Ask a question about the dataset..."

# Footer (shown in base template)
footer_title: "CIDOC-CRM Knowledge Graph Explorer"
footer_subtitle: "Powered by graph-based RAG with CIDOC-CRM ontology"

# Example questions (generic - datasets should override these)
example_questions:
  - "What entities are in this dataset?"
  - "Tell me about the main objects"

# About section - describes the RAG system (not dataset-specific)
